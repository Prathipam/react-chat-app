I built group chat application where the user should register/log in to interact or to see the previous history

All the messages are encrypted and stored in the database. Used MERN stack, socket io to create chat application.

To use this application, 

1. make dev.js file inside server/config folder 
2. put mongoDB and APP_KEY info into dev.js file (Mongo_Url and APP_KEY details sent in email)
3. Type  " npm install " inside the root directory  ( Download Server Dependencies ) 
4. Type " npm install " inside the client directory ( Download Front-end Dependencies )
